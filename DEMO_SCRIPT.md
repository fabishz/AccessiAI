## Part 3: Live Demo (8-10 minutes)

### Demo 1: Analyzing a Simple Website

**URL**: https://example.com

**Steps**:

1. **Enter the URL**
   - Click on the URL input field
   - Type: `https://example.com`
   - Say: "Let's analyze a simple website to see how AccessiAI works"

2. **Click "Analyze Page"**
   - Click the blue "Analyze Page" button
   - Show the loading spinner
   - Say: "The application is now analyzing the webpage. It's extracting images, checking color contrast, and identifying missing ARIA labels."

3. **Wait for results** (30-60 seconds)
   - Say: "While we wait, let me explain what's happening behind the scenes:
     - The parser extracts all images, text elements, and interactive elements
     - The image analyzer uses AI to generate descriptions for images without alt text
     - The contrast checker validates color combinations against WCAG standards
     - The ARIA suggester recommends labels for interactive elements"

4. **Review the Summary**
   - Point to the summary metrics
   - Say: "Here's the summary of what we found:
     - Total issues: [X]
     - Alt text issues: [X]
     - Contrast issues: [X]
     - ARIA issues: [X]"

5. **Expand Alt Text Issues**
   - Click on the first alt text issue
   - Show the current alt text (likely empty)
   - Show the suggested alt text generated by AI
   - Say: "Notice how the AI generated a descriptive caption for this image. This is what screen reader users would hear."

6. **Expand Contrast Issues** (if any)
   - Click on a contrast issue
   - Show the current colors and ratio
   - Show the suggested fix
   - Say: "This text has a contrast ratio of 3.2:1, but WCAG requires 4.5:1 for readability. We suggest changing the text color to achieve the required contrast."

7. **Expand ARIA Issues** (if any)
   - Click on an ARIA issue
   - Show the element type and issue
   - Show the suggested aria-label
   - Say: "This button lacks a text label. We suggest adding this aria-label so screen reader users understand what the button does."

### Demo 2: Analyzing a More Complex Website

**URL**: https://www.wikipedia.org

**Steps**:

1. **Enter the URL**
   - Clear the previous URL
   - Type: `https://www.wikipedia.org`
   - Say: "Let's try a more complex website with more content and images"

2. **Click "Analyze Page"**
   - Click the button
   - Show the loading spinner

3. **Wait for results** (60-90 seconds)
   - Say: "This website has more content, so the analysis takes a bit longer. The system is analyzing up to 10 images and checking hundreds of text elements."

4. **Review Results**
   - Show the summary
   - Say: "Even well-designed websites often have accessibility issues. Here's what we found on Wikipedia."

5. **Highlight Key Findings**
   - Show examples of each issue type
